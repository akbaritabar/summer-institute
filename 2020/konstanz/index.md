**ATTENTION: SICSS-Konstanz has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19.**

From the evening of Sunday, July 19 to Friday, July 31, 2020, the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) will host a partner location at University of Konstanz. The purpose of SICSS Konstanz is to bring together interested Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral students and junior faculty in Germany. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures and group problem sets in the first week and participant-led research projects in the second week. Participants will be able to work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the lectures. SICSS Konstanz will particularly focus on inference in Computational Social Science and potential issues with regards to measuring latent variables, causal explanation and generalization of study results. Covered topics include collecting digital trace data, automated text analysis, estimation of latent traits, adjustments for non-probability samples and missing data, and digital field experiments.

There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants and visiting speakers. In addition to providing state of the art education, SICSS Konstanz has the goal to build and expand the network of computational social scientists in Germany. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

We are inviting applications from Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and untenured faculty within 6 years of their PhD. Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. Participants with little or no exposure to sociology, economics, or political science, will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute. Most of the coding work presented at SICSS Konstanz will employ the R programming language. Participants with less coding experience will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules for R.

There is no cost for participating in the Summer Institute including meals. For a limited number of participants, we will be able to cover travel and accommodation up to a set cap. Please indicate in your application if this support is needed.
