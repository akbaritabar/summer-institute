# Eligibility

We invite applications from Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 6 years of their PhD. The Summer Institute will be held in English. We expect to invite about 20 to 30 participants for this partner location in Konstanz. 

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience in social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.

The aim of this partner location is to build and expand a network of computational social scientists in Germany. We invite applications not only from participants with a background in both computational methods and social science, but especially from those who seek to acquire new skills in either of these domains. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

We ask that you provide some basic information about yourself and your academic background. To be considered, all applicants must submit the following documents in English via the link above: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum two pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. 

All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g. phone number). We can offer support grants to cover housing and travel costs for a limited number of non-local participants, up to a set cap. Please indicate in your application whether you want to be considered for receiving a support grant.

~~In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be received by **Tuesday, February 25**. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in mid-March, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to compsocsci.konstanz[at]gmail.com.~~

Applications were due on Tuesday, February 25. We are no longer accepting applications.



### Application - Frequently Asked Questions


Can bachelor students also apply? Can associate or full professors also apply?

No, unfortunately applications are only possible for Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 6 years of their (first) PhD.


Can I also submit a writing sample written in German?

If you are a Master or PhD student and can not yet provide an English writing sample, it is possible to submit a sample written in German. However, in this case you are required to provide an additional proof of English proficiency appended to one of your application files. This must not necessarily be a certificate from a language test. For instance, you can also provide a statement about a considerable amount of time spent in an English speaking country.


Filling out the form requires a google account. Can I rather submit my application elsewhere?

It is only possible to submit your application via the form linked above. However, it does not matter which google account you use to fill out the form. No data associated with the account are relevant for the application. If you nevertheless feel uncomfortable about uploading files, you can instead provide (working!) links to external sources. As an example, instead of uploading your C.V. in the form, you could upload a file including a link to your C.V. file stored elsewhere.


I would like to know more about the topics covered at SICSS Konstanz. Can you provide more details?

We are currently still in the process of finalizing the schedule. It might be helpful for you to know that it will be similar (but not identical) to the schedule of [SICSS 2019 Bamberg](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/bamberg/schedule).

Can I apply to multiple SICSS partner sites at the same time?

No, you can not have an application under review at more than one site at a time.
