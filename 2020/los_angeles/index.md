From Monday June 15 to Friday June 25 2020, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Division of Social Sciences, California Center for Population Research, and SICSS core sponsors will sponsor a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science to be held at UCLA. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. **A site-specific focus at this partner institute will be machine-learning methods and/for causal inference.** There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About forty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. This is a non-residential program, so unfortunately we cannot reimburse travel and lodging expenses. However, refreshments will be provided.

**~~Application materials are due Thursday March 12, 2020.In light of the current situation, we are extending the deadline to Wednesday April 1, 2020. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis thereafter.~~**

**~~UPDATE 3/31/2020: At this point we are considering holding SICSS Los Angeles on time, virtually. However the situation is still developing, and we will follow the lead of the main site.~~**

**SICCS Los Angeles is officially going virtual! Expect decisions from us by the end of April. Thanks for your patience.**
