# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2020
## Day 5, Mass collaboration
## Prepared by Matt Salganik and Ian Lundberg<sup>1</sup>

### Summary

In this activity, participants will take part in a simulated Fragile Families Challenge.  They will use the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data collected from a child's birth to age 9 to predict 6 outcomes at child age 15: 1) child grade point average (GPA), 2) child grit, 3) household eviction, 4) household material hardship, 5) caregiver layoff, and 6) caregiver participation in job training.

### Learning objectives

- Practice converting raw survey data to a suitable format
- Practice machine learning for predictive modeling
- Experience the common task method

### Instruction preparation

To prepare for this activity you should:

- Complete the terms and conditions (link coming soon) for data access. Ian Lundberg will send you the data files. Contact him with questions.
- Participants will receive the data from us exactly as you do. Familiarize yourself with the files. They include components to support participants who may be falling behind, including a pre-prepared data file.
- Watch the video in which Matt introduces the activity (see the [curriculum](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/curriculum) page)
- Optional: Learn more about the Fragile Families Challenge from the [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915006117) or from the [project website](http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/).
- Optional: Watch videos from the [Fragile Families Challenge Scientific Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjluzrRT8fqXCx3qHjQAb5A)
- REMEMBER THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS SHOULD DELETE THEIR DATA WHEN THE ACTIVITY IS OVER. If they would like access to the data for future research, they should still delete the files we have sent and should [apply for access](https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/documentation) through the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study.

### Group formation

Form groups of roughly 3 people randomly. You might consider distributing those with the most predictive modeling experience across groups.

### Rough schedule

- One day in advance of the activity, direct your participants to complete the terms and conditions (link coming soon). Ian will send them the data as he sent it to you.
- Participants watch pre-recorded videos (in advance of activity)
- In groups, participants prepare a data file for analysis (1 hour)
- Break
- If participants have not yet prepared a data file for analysis, we recommend that they use the cleaned file that we provided so they can proceed to the next step
- In groups, participants build predictive models and submit to the [submission site](https://codalab.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/competitions/28) (2 hours)
- Whole group debrief for your site (15 minutes)


### Notes

- Participants should not expect to prepare the data and try many different sophisticated models in the time available. A good approach would be to focus on just one outcome of interest and try models of increasing complexity after successfully submitting a basic linear model to the leaderboard.
- This activity requires a lot of data wrangling and R fluency.
- Here are some tips about [data preparation](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day5-mass-collaboration/activity/SICSS_FFC_datacleaning_tips.pdf).
- If participants have trouble submitting, note that a basic submission file with the correct structure is provided in the files we sent them: ffchallenge_SICSS_2020/example_submission/example_for_upload.zip


<sup>1</sup> This lesson plan draws on a previous version prepared with Alex Kindel. The [Fragile Families Challenge](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915006117) is a mass collaboration organized by Matt Salganik, Ian Lundberg, Alex Kindel, and Sara McLanahan, conducted with an additional 108 authors.
