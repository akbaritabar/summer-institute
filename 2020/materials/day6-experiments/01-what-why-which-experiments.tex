What's the same?
\begin{itemize}
\item recruiting participants
\item randomization treatment
\item delivering treatment and control
\item measuring outcomes

What's different?
\begin{itemize}
\item Fully digital experiment leads to zero variable cost data.
\pause
\item Constraint on size is not cost, it is ethics.
