# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2020
## Day 1, Ethics
## Prepared by Matthew Salganik, Robin Lee, and Ian Lundberg

### Summary

In this activity, participants will split into small groups, discuss a case study, and then all come together to debrief on discussions.

### Learning objectives

- Participants will practice identifying ethical issues in real or proposed research, discussing ethical issues with colleagues, and proposing changes in research design to improve ethical balance.  
- Participants will get a chance to get to know each other on the first day.

### Instructor preparation

To prepare for this activity you should:
- Read the [lesson plan for participants](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day1-intro-ethics/activity/lesson_plan_ethics_participants.md).
- Read the case study: [Case study (Hacked data)](https://bdes.datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Patreon-Case-Study.pdf)
- Read the notes about the case study that we have prepared. These notes are available on Slack only to local organizers.  Please don’t share them with your participants.  We don’t want them to shape the discussion.  

### Group information

There is no specific guidance about how the groups should be formed; purely randomly should work well for this activity.

We have not had a virtual SICSS before so we are not sure what is the ideal group size.  We would recommend trying this with groups of between 3 and 5 people.

### Rough schedule

These times assume that you have 1 hours 45 minutes.  If you have less or more time, you can just inflate or deflate times as needed.

- 15 minutes: Form groups and introduce activity

- 60 minutes: read and discuss case study in small groups

- 30 minutes: guided discussed of case study by all participants lead by local organizer (try to discover and highlight the similarities and differences between groups)

### Notes

- There is another case study that you could use [Alternative case study (Field experiments on voting)](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day1-intro-ethics/activity/ethics_case_study.pdf).  If you use this case study, you should also read the original [Gerber et al. article](https://isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/ISPS08-001.pdf).
