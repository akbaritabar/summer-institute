# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2020
## Day 1, Ethics
## Prepared by Matthew Salganik, Robin Lee, and Ian Lundberg

### Summary

In this activity, participants will split into small groups, discuss a case study, and then all come together to debrief and discuss.

### Learning objectives

- Participants will practice identifying ethical issues in real or proposed research, discussing ethical issues with colleagues, and proposing changes in research design to improve ethical balance.  
- Participants will get a chance to get to know each other on the first day.

### Instructor preparation

To prepare for this activity you should:
- Read the [lesson plan for participants](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day1-intro-ethics/activity/lesson_plan_ethics_participants.md).
- Read the case study: [Case study (Hacked data)](https://bdes.datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Patreon-Case-Study.pdf)
- Think about some possible questions that you could use in the discussion, in addition to the questions assigned in the activity.

Here some possibilities:

Question 1) Does the illegal nature of the data collection and the release of private data taint the data in the release that was already publicly available?

Possible follow-ups to question 1:
- What if the data breach was accidental rather than a hack?
- What if the data hack was intentionally done by a competitor to Patreon with the goal of putting them out of business?
- What if the data release was intentional by Patreon even if it violates users' expectations?  For example, the release of the AOL search log data: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html (see also: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/technology/23search.html)
- What kind of precedent would this set? Would other researchers then hack data and release it anonymously?
- How can you ensure the accuracy of the data?

Question 2) Users of Patreon initially had an expectation of privacy, but that privacy no longer exists. Do researchers need to respect the intent or the reality?

Possible follow-up questions:
- What if these were electronic medical records?  Would that be different?

Question 3) Scholars and journalists share some functions in dealing with information and making it accessible to the public, but are the ethical considerations the same? If not, why not?

Possible follow-up questions:
- Journalists are often supervised by editors. Would it make the project more ethically permissible if these researchers had some third-party ethical review from an organization like an IRB?
- Journalists doing investigative reporting often work to expose wrong-doing. Some academic research is like that and some is not. Does it matter about the specific nature of the research?

Question 4) Researchers will nearly always claim that their research will have a net public benefit and thus their methods are justified. Who gets to decide is that is accurate in any given case?

Possible follow-up questions:
- If they used the data and you were reviewing the paper for a journal, would you accept it?
- If you were going to use the data, how would you describe it in an ethical appendix?
- Here's a case where researchers used diplomatic cables that were released by Private Manning to WikiLeaks: https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpv005. How are these cases similar or different? What do you think about the decision of these researchers?

Question 5) Would you personally use this data?

Possible follow-up questions:
- Many of the questions above could be used here.

### Group information

There is no specific guidance about how the groups should be formed; purely randomly should work well for this activity.

We have not had a virtual SICSS before so we are not sure what is the ideal group size.  We would recommend trying this with groups of between 3 and 5 people.

### Rough schedule

These times assume that you have 1 hours 45 minutes.  If you have less or more time, you can just inflate or deflate times as needed.

- 15 minutes: Form groups and introduce activity

- 60 minutes: read and discuss case study in small groups

- 30 minutes: guided discussed of case study by all participants lead by local organizer (try to discover and highlight the similarities and differences between groups)

### Notes

- There is another case study that you could use [Alternative case study (Field experiments on voting)](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day1-intro-ethics/activity/ethics_case_study.pdf).  If you use this case study, you should also read the original [Gerber et al. article](https://isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/ISPS08-001.pdf).

- Try to encourage participants to use the topics covered in SICSS (e.g., respect for persons, beneficence, justice, respect for law and public interest) in their discussion.

### Acknowledgments

This activity was designed with input from participants and TAs from SICSS 2017-2019, especially Yo-Yo Chen, Janet Xu, and Simone Zhang.
