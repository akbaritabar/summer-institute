Field experiments to study discrimination, at least 117 studies in 17 countries (Riach and Rich, 2002; Rich 2014)\\

\begin{frame}

Principles-based argument
\begin{itemize}
\item the limited harm to the employers
\pause
\item the great social benefit of having reliable measure of discrimination
\pause
\item the weakness of other methods of measuring discrimination
\pause
\item the fact that deception does not strongly violate the norms of that setting
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

Rules-based argument
\begin{itemize}
\item Dozens of IRBs approved (probably based on Common Rule ยง46.116, part (d))
\pause
\item US courts have also supported the lack of consent and use of deception in field experiments to measure discrimination (No. 81-3029.
US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit).

Biggest risk from much of computational social science is informational risk.  Harms from the disclosure of personal information could be: 

\begin{itemize}
\item economic (e.g., losing a job)
\item social (e.g., embarrassment)
\item psychological (e.g., depression)
\item criminal (e.g., arrest for illegal behavior)
