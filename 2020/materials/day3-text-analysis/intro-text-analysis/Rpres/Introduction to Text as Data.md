Harold Laswell
========================================================
&nbsp; 

"We may classify references into categories," wrote Laswell in 1938, " according to the understanding which prevails among those who are accustomed to the symbols. References used in interviews may be quantified by counting the number of references which fall into each category during a selected period of time (or per thousand words uttered)."



Ahead of his time?
========================================================
&nbsp;

In 1935- and at the age of 21-Laswell was developing methods that tracked the association between word utterances and physiological reactions (e.g. pulse rate, electrical conductivity of the skin, and blood pressure)
