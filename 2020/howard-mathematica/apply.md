Participation in the SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI is open to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. Most participant costs during the session, including housing and most meals will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. About thirty participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less coding experience will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science, 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others, 3) likelihood to benefit from participation, 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants, and 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, you may apply to more than one summer institute, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Howard/Mathematica, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Do I need to submit recommendation letters?

Recommendation letters are not required for SICSS-Howard/Mathematica.
