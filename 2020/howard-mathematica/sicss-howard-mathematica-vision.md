#### SICSS-Howard/Mathematica Vision
For SICSS-Howard/Mathematica we have an added purpose, to seed and grow a depth of knowledge and appreciation for computational social science in underrepresented communities.  SICSS-Howard/Mathematica is uniquely poised to highlight innovative methods to conduct social research on topics of pertinence to underrepresented communities using real-world data. Participants who share our drive to use computer science, data analytics, and evidence to improve public well-being within underrepresented communities will benefit from the opportunities and resources that are unique to SICSS-Howard/Mathematica given our presence at Howard University, the generous support and deep engagement of Mathematica, and our presence in the nation’s capital.

#### Howard University
Established in 1867, Howard University is a federally chartered, private, doctoral degree granting Historically Black 
University. With an enrollment of over 9,000 students (3,000 of which are graduate students), it’s undergraduate, 
graduate, professional, and joint degree programs span more than 120 areas of study within 13 schools and colleges. 
The historic main campus sits on two hundred and fifty-six acres on a hilltop in Northwest Washington blocks from the 
storied U Street and Howard Theatre and two miles from the U.S. Capitol. Howard University’s founding of 
<i>SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI with Mathematica</i> is yet another way that Howard continues its commitment to the context of our founding – an unwavering question to balance the scales for the 
disenfranchised, and promote an American that is devoid of inequalities.  Howard has existed to address a plethora of 
disparities that disproportionately affect the African-American population wherever it may occur.  AI presents a rapidly 
evolving frontier where new voices are needed more than ever to promote <i>Veritas and Utilitias</i> (Truth and Service).

“Howard University’s founding of SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI with Mathematica is yet another way that Howard continues its commitment to the context of our founding—an unwavering question to balance the scales for the disenfranchised, and promote an America that is devoid of inequalities,” says Howard University President Wayne A. I. Frederick.

#### Mathematica
Founded in 1968, Mathematica reimagines the way the world gathers and uses data, surfacing evidence and insights that 
illuminate the path to progress for public- and private-sector changemakers. Driven by our mission to improve public 
well-being and our steadfast commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion, Mathematica’s nearly 1400 employees 
collaborate closely with public- and private-sector partners to inform program and policy decisions in health, human services, 
and international development. Throughout <i>SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI</i>, our data and public policy experts will work alongside participants to help translate big questions into deep insights that improve programs, refine strategies, and enhance equity.

“This program provides aspiring researchers with insights to help them operate at the intersection of data science and social science, as well as surface new ways to apply an equity lens to that work—two topics that are poised to shape the future of public policy for years to come,” said [Paul Decker](https://www.mathematica.org/our-people/staff/paul-decker), president and CEO of Mathematica. “We are incredibly proud to stand with Howard University in shining a light on the importance of ethics and equity as artificial intelligence gains a foothold in more and more ways.”
