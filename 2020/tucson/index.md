From January 3 to January 9 of 2021, the SICSS core sponsors and the University of Arizona will sponsor the first Winter Institute in Computational Social Science, a partner site for SICSS. The purpose of the event is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty interested in computational social science. The event is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will be several guest speakers conducting data and social science research in a variety of fields, including communication, linguistics, political science, and sociology. Topics covered include text as data, social network modeling, digital traces and web scraping, experimental and quasi-experimental methods, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. 

Approximately twenty to thirty participants will be selected. Participants are expected to be present for the entire one-week program. Meals will be provided, but participants will be responsible for arranging travel and accomodation.

Application materials are due by July 1, 2020.

***COVID-19 update: We are still planning to host an in-person event in January but will be monitoring the situation closely and may have to make changes to the program if necessary. We will post any updates on this page.***
