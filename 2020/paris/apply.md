Participation is restricted to advanced master students, Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career stage faculty. Please note that there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.  About 20 participants will be invited. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Please note the following points: 

- The summer institute will be taught **in French**. A good command of the language is thus necessary.
- some familiarity with one programming language is a plus, and should be clearly mentioned. **The workshop will be taught using R.**
- We also expect participants to have a good reading & speaking ability in English.
