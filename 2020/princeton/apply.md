# Eligibility

Participation is restricted to individuals who work in government. We will consider a) applicants currently in roles in which they use data to solve policy problems or improve public administration and b) applicants transitioning to such a role because their organization is currently building capacity in these areas.  Applicants should have some training in or job-related experience with datasets and using statistical tools. We impose no restrictions based on citizenship, country of employment, level of government, or substantive policy area. 

The Summer Institute aims to bring together participants across levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience coding, however, will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. 

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, especially applicants from groups under-represented in computational social science and public service. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) past, current, and proposed future work using computational social science, 2) likelihood to benefit from participation, 3) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants, 4) likelihood to contribute to improving their organizations and communities. When making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant's career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Please note that the language of instruction is English. 

# How to Apply
Applicants should submit their application via [this form](https://forms.gle/evvyx8qf8Q9nSWg16). 

We ask applicants to upload: (i) a resume, and (ii) a statement of interest (maximum 2 pages single-spaced) describing your current role in public service and your interest in computational social science. 

All application materials must be submitted by **Sunday, April 5, 2020**. We will notify applicants through e-mail in mid/late April, and will ask participants to confirm their participation soon thereafter.

Questions about the application can be sent to sicsscitp@gmail.com.
