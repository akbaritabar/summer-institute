**ATTENTION: SICSS-PrincetonCITP has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19.**

From the evening of June 14 to 19, 2020, the [Princeton University Center for Information Technology Policy](https://citp.princeton.edu/) will host a partner site for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. 

The Princeton-CITP Summer Institute is unique among partner locations in its target population: individuals who work in government interested in using computational social science to improve the agencies and communities they serve.
 
The instructional program will involve lectures, group activities, and participant-led information exchange and problem solving. There will also be guest speakers from institutions and organizations who conduct computational social science research in a variety of policy-relevant settings. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, machine learning, network analysis, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and work with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers.

Participation is restricted to individuals working in government. Applicants should be currently in or transitioning to roles in which they use data to solve policy problems or improve public administration. Applicants should have some training in or job-related experience with datasets and using statistical tools. 

Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, levels of government, and geographic areas, especially applicants from groups under-represented in computational social science and public service. About fifteen participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program held at Princeton University. 

In addition to the SICSS core sponsors, the Princeton-CITP partner event is supported by the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy and the Data Driven Social Science Initiative. 

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/princeton/apply) are due **April 5, 2020**. Inquiries may be sent to sicsscitp@gmail.com.
