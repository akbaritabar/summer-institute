### Update: Because of COVID-19, SICSS-Rutgers 2020 will be switched from an in-person event to a virtual event from June 15th-26th. Our new application deadline is May 1.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, and especially encourage applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science and those whose research seeks to contribute to social progress (broadly conceived), particularly research related to the study of race, gender, sexuality, or systemic social and economic inequality. Note: You do not need to be affiliated with Rutgers to attend the institute. 

All applications will be given consideration, and we hope to assemble a diverse set of participants across many backgrounds and levels of expertise. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research, particularly research areas related to social progress (broadly conceived) and the study of race, gender, sexuality, or systemic social and economic inequality. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
<br />

We expect participants to attend the full institute. If you anticipate a conflict with portions of each day or 1 or more full days of the institute, please just note this in your application.
