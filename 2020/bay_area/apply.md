Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.  About 30 participants will be invited. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. 

Since a core aim of BAY-SICSS is creating ongoing partnerships between computational social scientists and Bay Area nonprofits, we are particularly invite applicants interested in pursuing such work. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research, and 6) fit with the thematic focus of BAY-SICSS. When making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Applicants should submit their application via this [Qualtrics link](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bIN3mvByFkf2fgF). The application gives us a chance to get to know more about you and your interest, as well as the kinds of organizations you would like to collaborate with during BAY-SICSS.

We also ask applicants to upload the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, and (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. 

**Applications were due May 1, 2020.** We will notify selected applicants through e-mail in mid-late May, and will ask participants to confirm their participation soon thereafter.
