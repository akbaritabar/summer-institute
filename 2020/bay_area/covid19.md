At the moment we are still planning to hold BAY-SICSS 2020. And we are committed to doing so in a way that maximizes benefit to the community—that is a core part of our mission in developing and applying computational skills. It’s important to us to keep everyone involved safe in the environment of BAY-SICSS—which, it’s worth noting, is based around an immersive, hands-on model of learning. In other words, the actual gathering is an essential aspect of the institute.

And as you know, news and suggestions about a public health response to the coronavirus--now including shelter-in-place orders--come out fast. Policies around social distancing and quarantining may become still more firm and widespread in coming days—but we have no way of knowing when we may reach “containment”, thus decreasing the need for distancing and allowing a transition back to normal social life. So we are following the lead of the main SICSS site (at Duke) and not making any stark decisions just now about whether or not to hold BAY-SICSS—and if so, in what capacity. Again, our priority is to keep everyone safe and contain the spread of the virus. To support this intention, we may change our approach in the coming weeks. 

With that in mind, we encourage you to apply if you haven’t already. The application portal will remain open until we have a game plan for the likely scenario of this summer, which would allow us to conduct a full application review.
