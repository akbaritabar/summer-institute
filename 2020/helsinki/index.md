**ATTENTION: SICSS-Helsinki has been postponed due to COVID-19. New dates are currently unknown.**

We will organize a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Helsinki, Finland.
The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science.
The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects.
There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government.
The Helsinki Summer Institute will focus to examine forthcoming book "Coding Social Science. Understanding and Doing Computational Social Science."
We will focus on computational methods used in social science: data science, network analysis, simulation models and digital tools in experimental research.
There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers.
Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Masters and Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and tenure track faculty.
We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.
About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

We thank [Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT](https://www.hiit.fi/) for their support for this activity.
