## Travel reimbursement policy for SICSS 2020 at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM)

The Summer Institute will be providing economy class transportation to and from the Summer Institute for all accepted participants (coming from outside Montréal). Due to funding limitations, we are only able to provide travel costs up to a fixed cap, which is based on the home institution of the participant. Accepted participants are encouraged to search for additional funding as well. 

Due to funding limitations:
- we are not able to provide reimbursement for meals or other incidental expenses. Meals during the summer institute will be provided onsite free fro participants.
- we are only able to cover economy travel costs.
- we are not able to reimburse travel between your home and the airport (or train station) or between the airport (or train station) and campus.

Inquiries can be sent to sicss.montreal at gmail dot com.
