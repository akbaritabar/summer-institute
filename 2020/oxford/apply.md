**IMPORTANT NOTICE: We have taken the reluctant decision to postpone SICSS 2020 due to the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic. We are planning to re-host the same (or as similar an event as possible) in the summer of 2021. If you have already applied, you should have received an email with further details. The following SICSS partner sites are still running a virtual event: SICSS-Duke, BAY-SICSS, SICSS-Istanbul, SICSS-Los Angeles, SICSS-Maastricht and SICSS-Montr√©al. Many of these sites will be offering open-access online events. Please check back for further details regarding SICSS-Oxford 2021 in due course!**

We will be inviting applications from PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their PhD. Exceptional Master's students in a research-track degree (e.g. MRes, MPhil) or transitioning to a PhD programme will also be considered. We are hoping to have wide participation from researchers across different departments and institutes within the University of Oxford, both from the social sciences and the computational/data sciences. We would also like to welcome a limited number of participants from other institutions both in the UK and abroad. The Summer Institute will be held in English. We expect to invite about 25 participants for this partner location in Oxford. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.

Participants are expected to attend both weeks of the institute. Meals and refreshments will be provided free of cost for all participants at SICSS-Oxford during the event. There are no registration fees to attend the Institute. For participants from outside Oxford, we will provide a limited number of scholarships to support accommodation and travel to Oxford (up to a set cap).

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We will evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research interests, ideas, and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. We will attempt to account for an applicant's career stage and previous educational opportunities when evaluating applications.

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research, your interest in computational science science, as well as why you would like to attend SICSS-Oxford (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable but when submitting co-authored work we recommend you include a few sentences describing the contribution of each individual author to the work. *Applications must be submitted as one combined PDF file by email to sicss.oxford[at]nuffield.ox.ac.uk.*

1. First Name:
2. Last Name: 
3. Email Address:
4. Discipline of (expected) PhD degree: 
5. Current University/College:

Please note that letters of recommendation are not required for application to SICSS-Oxford and any letters, if submitted, will not be considered when evaluating applications. This is to guarantee similar consideration of all applications.

**Further information regarding SICSS-Oxford-2021 will be published in due course. Inquiries can be sent to sicss.oxford[at]nuffield.ox.ac.uk.**

##### 1.  Can bachelor students also apply? Can full professors also apply?

No, unfortunately applying is only possible for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their PhD.

##### 2.  Can I also submit a writing sample written in a language other than English?

This is unfortunately not possible.

##### 3.  I'm a Masters student: can I apply?

We will consider applications from master's students in a research track (e.g. MPhil, MRes degrees), or MSc students transitioning to a PhD degree who have demonstrated interest and commitment to research in the area of computational social science.
