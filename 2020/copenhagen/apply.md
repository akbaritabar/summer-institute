Applications are invited from all interested individuals with particular emphasis on PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 5 years of their PhD. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.  We anticipate to admit about 20 participants. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. While we strongly encourage participants to commit for both weeks of the institute, we will consider exceptions for plausible reasons such as child or dependent care commitments. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
