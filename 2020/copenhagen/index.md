**ATTENTION: SICSS-Copenhagen has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19.**

From the evening of June 14 to June 26, the University of Copenhagen [Faculty of Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.ku.dk/) and the [Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences](https://healthsciences.ku.dk/) will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and academic staff within five years of their PhD interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is open to both social and health scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures and group problem sets during the first week, and the opportunity for participant-led research projects in week two. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered in coordination with the Duke University site include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. 

Applications are invited from all interested individuals with particular emphasis on PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 5 years of their PhD. There is no cost to participate, and we will provide lunch on all weekdays of the institute. Participation is not restricted by applicant's location, and we are working to secure funds to support travel and lodging for a limited number of participants. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We anticipate to admit about twenty participants.

**_Important notice_: We are closely monitoring the developments surrounding the global COVID-19 outbreak, especially the official government and university responses to it. We will take every precaution necessary to protect participants, staff, and the broader community. ~~At this point (March 27), we are still hoping to be able to host SICSS-Copenhagen in June and have decided to extend the application deadline until April 26th to provide interested individuals more time to apply. We will inform applicants about any changes to these plans via email and, for now, encourage all interested individuals to apply.~~**

~~[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/copenhagen/apply) are due April 26, 2020 and we aim to make admission decisions shortly thereafter.~~
