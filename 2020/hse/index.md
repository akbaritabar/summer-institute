**ATTENTION: SICSS-HSE has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19.**

From the evening of June 14 to June 20, the SICSS core sponsors and Higher School of Economics (HSE University) will sponsor a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at [HSE University in Moscow](https://www.hse.ru/en/). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

SICSS-HSE will feature local and visiting speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, live streams from Duke, and group problem sets. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, digital phenotyping, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. There is no registration fee for participating in SICSS-HSE. Meals and refreshments will be provided free of cost for all participants at SICSS-HSE during the event. Accommodation will be provided and travel costs will be [reimbursed up to a set cap](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/hse/travel) for those participants whose university is located outside Moscow. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About fifteen participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/hse/apply) are due March 30, 2020.
