## About HSE University
Consistently ranked as one of Russia’s top universities, HSE University is a leader in Russian education and one of the preeminent 
economics and social sciences universities in eastern Europe and Eurasia. Having rapidly grown into a well-renowned research 
university over two decades, HSE University sets itself apart with its international presence and cooperation.

Our faculty, researchers, and students represent over 50 countries, and are dedicated to maintaining the highest academic standards.  
Our newly-adopted structural reforms support HSE University’s drive to internationalize and the groundbreaking research of our faculty, 
researchers, and students.

Now a dynamic university with four campuses, HSE University is a leader in combining Russian education traditions with the best 
international teaching and research practices.  HSE University offers outstanding educational programmes from secondary school to 
doctoral studies, with top departments and research centres in a number of international fields.

Since 2013, HSE University has been a member of the 5-100 Russian Academic Excellence Project, a highly selective government 
programme aimed at boosting the international competitiveness of Russian universities.

The Laboratory of Computational Social Science was established in 2019 to advance our understanding of complex social systems and human behavior in the digital age and to promote computational social science in Russia. The main focus of our research is on digital inequality and well-being in the digital age. Our research program is supported by Basic Research Program of HSE and by Russian Science Foundation. We also teach computational social science for master’s and doctoral students at HSE.
