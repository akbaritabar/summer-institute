## Travel reimbursement policy for SICSS 2020 at HSE University
The Summer Institute at HSE will provide accommodation and reimburse economy class transportation to and from the Summer Institute for those accepted participants whose home university is located outside Moscow. Due to funding limitations, we are only able to reimburse travel costs up to a fixed cap, which is based on the home institution of the participant. The cost caps for travel are:

- European Russia: $150
- Other parts of Europe: $300
- Other parts of the world: $400

Due to funding limitations:
- we are not able to provide reimbursement for visa services, meals, or other incidental expenses.  
- we are only able to cover economy travel costs.
- we are not able to reimburse travel between your home and the airport (or train station) or between the airport 
(or train station) and HSE.
