[RTI International](https://www.rti.org/) (RTI) is proud to host and be a partner institution of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) from the morning of Monday, June 17 to evening of Friday, June 28. Sessions and lectures will take place in tandem with the main event at Princeton University, along with 9 other partner institutions around the world. 

RTI will be the only non-university to host a partner site for SICSS. RTI is an independent, nonprofit research institute centrally located between Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State University. 

### About the Summer Institute at RTI:

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. It is for both social and data scientists, broadly conceived.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. Topics will include:

- Text as data
- Website scraping
- Digital field experiments
- Non-probability sampling
- Mass collaboration
- Ethics  

In the afternoons of the first week, participants will work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the morning lectures. In the second week, participants will join teams to develop a research project related to computational social science. RTI will also feature live streams of speakers at Princeton University and other locations in addition to local speakers at RTI during the two weeks. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. All materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

**All events will be held at:**<br>
