Below is the script used to generate "cleaned_acs17.csv". We use person weights from the 2017 American Community Survey (a 1-in-100 national random sample of the population) to calculate the population of demographic groups in the US. If you would like to run this script yourself (or calculate populations using additional variables and/or different groups), you can get an ACS data extract from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group).

```{r setup, echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)

# load ACS data 
acs <- read.csv("local_data/2017acs_extract.csv")

# Sample: 
#   2017 ACS
# Data format: 
#   .csv
# Structure: 
#   Rectangular (person)
# Variables:
#   US2017A_REGION 	Region code
#   PERWT 	        Person weight
#   US2017A_AGEP 	  Age
#   US2017A_SCHL 	  Educational attainment
#   US2017A_SEX 	  Sex
#   US2017A_HISP 	  Recoded detailed Hispanic origin
#   US2017A_RAC1P 	Recoded detailed race code
