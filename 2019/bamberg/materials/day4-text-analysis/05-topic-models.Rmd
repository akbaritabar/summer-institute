# Introducing topic models



## Vanilla topic modeling - latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)

> "Topic models are algorithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large and otherwise unstructured collection of documents. Topic models can organize the collection according to the discovered themes." (Blei 2012)


- LDA is a mixed membership model and the name is based upon the [dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution)
- idea: texts are generated by latent topics.
- each document is a mixture over topics. Each topic is a mixture over words
- we have to fix the number of topics ex ante


## LDA - A statistical highlighter

```{r, out.width='100%', echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/lda_picture_blei2012.png')
```


*Blei (2012). Probabilistic Graphical Models.*


## LDA - disadvantages

- the initialization of LDA models is not deterministic: starting parameters are initially set to random values. This affects model stability and introduces repllication problems
- good implementations of LDA topic models often require dependencies beyond R (e.g. java for [mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/))
- LDA is "blind" to context information. It only models term co-occurence without considering meta data

## Introducing the Structural Topic Model (STM)

- Text documents often include contextual information, e.g. time stamps or author attributes
- A huge variety of social science questions is motivated by connecting metadata with textual data
- STM provides two ways to include contextual information:

    - Topic prevelance can vary by metadata (e.g. Democrats talk more about education than Republicans)
    - Topic content can vary by metadata (e.g. Democrats are less likely to use the word life when talking about abortion than Republicans)
- you can find many publications and auxiliary packages for STM on [structuraltopicmodel.com](structuraltopicmodel.com)

## STM - R Package

-  structural topic models can be estimated and interpreted with the R package `stm`
- the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf) introduces the functionality of the package and is worth a read
- package advantages:

    - very comprehensive documentation.
    - good starting values for hyperparameters
    - extensive functionality for validating and visualising models
    
- disadvantages: base R approach (no `ggplot2` graphics, no `tidy` data structures (we will fix that with  [stminsights](https://cschwem2er.github.io/stminsights/))   

## Reload our DonorsChoose data

```{r, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 60}
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)
library(stm)
library(stminsights)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
load('data/dfm_donor.Rdata')
dim(dfm_donor)
```

## Prepare textual data for STM

- You can provide input data for the stm package in several ways:

     - via STM's own functions for text pre-processing
     - via directly passing quanteda dfm's
     - using quanteda's `convert()` function to prepare dfm's (recommended option)
     
```{r}
out <- convert(dfm_donor, to = 'stm')
names(out)
```


## STM - model fitting 

For our first model, we will choose 30 topics and include school metro type (urban vs rural), teacher gender and a flexible [spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) for date as prevalence covariates:

```{r, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80, eval = FALSE}
stm_30 <- stm(documents = out$documents, 
      vocab = out$vocab,
      data = out$meta,
      K = 30, 
      prevalence = ~ school_metro_type + gender + s(date_num),
      verbose = TRUE) # show progress

stm_effects30 <- estimateEffect(1:30 ~ school_metro_type + 
      gender + s(date_num),
      stmobj = stm_30, metadata = out$meta)
```

## Saving and restoring models

- depending on the number of documents and the vocabulary size, fitting STM models can require a lot of memory and computation time
- it can be useful to save model objects as R binaries and reload them as needed:

```{r, eval = FALSE }
save(out, stm_30, stm_effects30, 
     file = "data/stm_donor.RData")
```

```{r}
load("data/stm_donor.RData") # reload data
```


# Model validation and interactively exploring STM models



## Model interpretation - topic proportions

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plot.STM(stm_30, type = 'summary', text.cex = 0.8)
```


## Model interpretation - probability terms

`label` plots show terms for each topic with (again) the most likely terms as a default:



```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plot.STM(stm_30, type = 'labels', n = 8, 
         text.cex = 0.8, width = 100, topics = 1:5)
```


## Model interpretation - frex terms

One strength of STM is that it also offers other metrics for topic terms. `frex` terms are both frequent and exclusive to a topic.


```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plot.STM(stm_30, type = 'labels', n = 8, text.cex = 0.8, 
         width = 100, topics = 1:5, labeltype = 'frex')
```


## Model interpretation - don't rely on terms only

- assigning labels for topics only by looking at the most likely terms is generally not a good idea
- sometimes these terms contain domain-specific stop words. Sometimes they are hard to make sense of by themselves
- recommendation: 

    - use probability (most likely) terms
    - use frex terms
    - **qualitatively examine representative documents**
    
    
## Model interpretation - representative documents

STM allows to find representative (unprocessed) documents for each topic with `findThoughts()`, which can then be plotted with `plotQuote()`: 

```{r , size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
thoughts <- findThoughts(stm_30, 
     texts = out$meta$text, # unprocessed documents
     topics = 1:3,  n = 2) # topics and number of documents

```


## Model interpretation - representative documents

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plotQuote(thoughts$docs[[3]][1], # topic 3 thought 1
          width = 100) 
```

## Interactive model validation - stminsights

You can interactively validate and explore structural topic models using the R package *stminsights*. What you need:

  - one or several stm models and corresponding effect estimates
  - the `out` object used to fit the models
  - the example `stm_donor.RData` includes all required objects


```{r eval=FALSE}
run_stminsights()
```

# Interpreting and visualizing prevalence and content effects

- we already estimated prevalence effects. Now we'll see how to also estimate content effects and how to visualize effects

- there are several options for interpreting and visualizing effects:
  
    - using functions of the STM package
    - using stminsights function `get_effects()`
    - usting stminsights interactive mode

## Prevalence effects (stm package)


- prevalence covariates affect topic proportions 
- they can be visualized in three ways:

    - `pointestimate`: pointestimates for categorical variables
    - `difference`: differences between topic proportions for two categories of one variable
    - `continuous`: line plots for continuous variables
- you can also visualize interaction effects if you integrated them in your STM model (see `?plot.estimateEffect()`)
    
## Prevalence effects - pointestimate

```{r, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plot.estimateEffect(stm_effects30, topic = 3, 
            covariate = 'school_metro_type', method = 'pointestimate')
```


## Prevalence effects - continuous

```{r, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plot.estimateEffect(stm_effects30, covariate = "date_num", 
                    topics = c(9:10), method = "continuous")
```

## Prevalence effects with stminsights

You can use `get_effects()` to store prevalence effects in a tidy data frame:

```{r, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
effects <- get_effects(estimates = stm_effects30,
                      variable = 'gender',
                      type = 'pointestimate')
```

Afterwards, effects can for instance be visualized with `ggplot2`

## Prevalence effects with stminsights

```{r, size = 'scriptsize', linewidth = 100, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
effects %>% filter(topic == 3 & value %in% c('Female', 'Male')) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = value, y = proportion)) + geom_point() +
 geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.1) +
 coord_flip() + labs(x = 'Gender', y = 'Topic Proportion')
```

## STM content effects

- content effects allow covariates to affect word distributions **within a topic**  (e.g. female teachers talk differently about sports in comparison to male teachers). Example model formula: ``content = ~ gender``
- this feature is powerful but comes with some disadvantages:

    - you can only use one discrete variable for content effects
    - interpreting the model is more complicated (see `labelTopics() and sageLabels()
    - we will focus on visualizing content effects with `perspective` plots

## Fitting content models

- content models can (but do not have to) be combined with prevalence models. We fit a model with 20 topics and teacher gender as content covariate
- important note: this as a new model and can show different results, even if you compare it to a model with the same number of topics

```{r, eval = FALSE, size = 'scriptsize', linewidth = 80}
stm_20_content <- stm(documents = out$documents, 
      vocab = out$vocab,
      data = out$meta,
      K = 20, 
      prevalence = ~ school_metro_type + gender + s(date_num),
      content = ~ gender,
      verbose = FALSE) # show progress
stm_effects20 <- estimateEffect(1:20 ~ school_metro_type + 
      gender + s(date_num),
      stmobj = stm_20_content, metadata = out$meta)
save(stm_20_content, stm_effects20,file =  "data/stm_donor_content.RData")
```

## Load content model

```{r}
load("data/stm_donor_content.RData") # reload data
```

## Visalizing content effects 

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=8, size = 'footnotesize', linewidth = 80}
plot.STM(stm_20_content, topics = c(2), type = 'perspectives', 
         covarlevels = c('Female', 'Male'))
```
