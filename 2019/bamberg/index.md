From the evening of Sunday, July 28 to Friday, August 09, 2019, the University of Bamberg hosted a partner event for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of SICSS Bamberg was to bring together interested Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral students and faculty in Germany. The Summer Institute was for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program involved lectures and group problem sets in the first week and participant-led research projects in the second week. Participants were able to work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the lectures. Covered topics included ethics, web scraping and collecting digital trace data, automated text analysis, network analysis, digital field experiments, and surveys in the digital age. There was ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. The goal of this partner location was to build and expand the network of computational social scientists in Germany.

We invited applications from Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 5 years of their PhD. Participants were expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. Participants with less experience with social science research were expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less coding experience were expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. There was no cost for participating in the Summer Institute. For a limited number of participants, the program covered housing and meal expenses up to a set cap.

Application materials were due Monday, February 25, 2019. We are no longer accepting applications.
