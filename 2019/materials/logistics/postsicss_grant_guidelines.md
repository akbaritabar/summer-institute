# Guidelines for post-SICSS grants

For people at the 2019 Princeton SICSS location, we were able to offer some grants during SICSS and we are able to offer larger grants afterwards. The purpose of this document is to describe the process of getting these post-SICSS grants.  As we said at SICSS, we hope to be able to give multiple grants of a several thousands of dollars.  The exact amounts that we can give will depend on the number of quality applications that we receive.  You should not ask for more money than you can producively use, and you should not for more than $10,000.  You should send you application to Chris and Matt via email.

## Timeline

Proposals will be due Monday, September 16, 2019 at 9am ET.  We expect that applicants will be notified of our decisions by Nonday, September 23 at 9am ET.  All money needs to be out of our accounts by October 31, 2019 so that we can close out our grant.  

## Proposal

Your proposal should include the following elements:

### Project title

### Applicants

Please include the affiliation (university and department); it is OK if your team changes some post-SICSS.

### Project description (about one page)

### Budget (about one paragraph and please include a table)

Please note that Russell Sage Foundation has a policy that all workers on micro-task platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) should be paid an hourly wage of at least $15.

### Financial logistics

Please describe how you think we should transfer the resources to your group. Remember we are not a grant making organization so we can best cover expenses that we can put on a credit card and that provide a receipt. Examples of expenses that we can cover include: participant fees on Amazon Mechanical Turk (or similar platforms) and cloud computing credits. The best process is for us to pay directly for the expense. If that is not possible, please email us before submitting your proposal and explain why you would need a different process.All funds need to be out of our accounts by October 31, 2019 so that we can close out our grant.

### Ethics and IRB issues

Please highlight any ethics and IRB issues raised by your research and describe how you plan to address them.

### Changes since SICSS

Please describe any changes to your project since SICSS. If the project has not changed, that's fine too.

### Open science policy

Please reaffirm that you understand that recipients of the grant should make their data and code available to other researchers when their papers are published. We understand that data availability may be tricky in some situations so if you anticipate any difficulties with following the open science policy please explain.

### Reporting policy

Please reaffirm that you will send us a copy of your paper or other outputs so that we can link to them from the SICSS website.
