# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2019
## Day 4, Surveys
## Prepared by Matt Salganik and Cambria Naslund

### Summary

In this activity, participants will work in groups to deploy an attitude survey to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).  Then, they can use a data set that we have pre-collected from MTurk and weight the data to attempt to recover estimates from a high-quality probability sample.  At the end of the activity, they should de-identify their data, document it, and share it with their local organizer.  The local organizer can then post the data and documentation on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/tree/master/2019/materials/day4-surveys/datasets).

### Learning objectives

- Designing and deploying a survey
- Familiarity with MTurk
- Strengths and weaknesses of non-probability samples
- Practice data wrangling and weighing non-probability samples
- Practice collecting data that can be released
- Practice using the total survey error framework to reason about and discussion sources of errors in estimates
- Practice de-identifying and releasing data (to your local organizer)

### Instruction preparation

To prepare for this activity you should:
- Read the [slides](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2019/materials/day4-surveys/05-intro-to-activity.pdf) that I will use to introduce the activity
- Read the [paper](https://5harad.com/papers/dirtysurveys.pdf) that inspired this activity
- Prepare one temporary MTurk account for each group that will be collecting data (if funding is available to support this data collection)

### Group formation

Form groups of about 5 people randomly.  If possible, each group should have one person with experience in surveys and one person with experience in MTurk.  The more groups you have, the higher the costs of data collection because each group will collect some data.

### Rough schedule

60 minutes: Prepare and deploy surveys

Break for lunch while data is being collected

60 minutes: Analyze data

30 minutes: Archive data

15 minutes: Discuss activity

### Notes

- If you are collecting data when many people in the United States might be asleep (or not on MTurk), the data collection might be slower.  You can relax the location requirement if you wish.  The data we collected was from people in the United States, and your participants can do their analysis on that dataset.

- If you do not have money for MTurk fees, you can have participants take the surveys that were created by other groups.

- This activity asks groups to document and release the data that they collect to the local organizer.  If you have any doubts about privacy, just don't release the data and turn it into a teachable moment.

- Some participants might be frustrated that data archiving takes time.  That's OK.  That's an important part of this activity and the research process.

- Please help participants have realistic expectations of what can be completed during this activity.
