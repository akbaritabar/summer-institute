From the evening of Sunday, June 16 to the morning of Saturday, June 29, 2019, the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science will host a partner location at the School of Economics of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon (UANL) in Monterrey, Mexico. The purpose of SICSS-Monterrey is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science in Mexico. 
The site is organized by Oscar Mendez, from UANL, and Adaner Usmani, from Brown University. 

The instructional program will feature lectures live-streamed from the main site at Princeton University, as well as group problem sets and participant-led research projects. SICSS-Monterrey will also welcome outside speakers who are experts in computational social science research. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. The partner location officially ends on June 29, but until July 6 both Oscar and Adaner will be available to help students with their research projects. Those who plan to work on projects will also be able to apply to SICSS-Monterrey for some funding.

We are inviting applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Meals will be provided during the workshop and we expect to invite about twenty to thirty participants. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience with coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language as well as attend a preparatory workshop in advance of the Institute. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

Application materials will be due on Friday, March 29, 2019.

All events will be held at:

Facultad de Economia, UANL

Avenida Lázaro Cárdenas 4600 Ote. Fracc. Residencial Las Torres

Monterrey, Nuevo Leon

Mexico
