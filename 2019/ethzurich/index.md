ETH Z端rich is hosting the first-ever SICSS in Switzerland! The event will take place through 16-29 June 2019 as an intensive summer school in computational social science in the beautiful city of Z端rich. Sessions and lectures will take place in tandem with the flagship event at Princeton University, along with 9 other partner sites around the world.

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together professionals, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science.
The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects.
There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government.
Topics covered include

* text as data
* digital democracy
* machine translation
* digital traces and website scraping
* digital field experiments
* non-probability sampling
* mass collaboration
* network analysis
* ethics
* introduction to machine learning

There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers.
Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.


See [details for applications](/summer-institute/2019/ethzurich/apply) and apply by March 1st.

The Summer Institute in Computational Social Science is funded in part by grants from the Russell Sage Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
The institute at ETH Z端rich is also supported by ETH Z端rich.
