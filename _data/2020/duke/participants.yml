I received his Ph.D. in Social Psychology from the University of Virginia in 2020. My research focuses on the intersection of the real world and the psychological theories we use to describe it, using a socioecological approach to understand contemporary society. I examine how structural, demographic, geographic, cultural, and historical factors create individual psychology in real-world contexts, trying to understand peculiarly American beliefs, such as the protective utility of firearms, the blame that comes from thinking that hard work alone is all that is needed for success, and the effects of slowing American residential mobility.

  bio: "Carlos is a PhD candidate in Information Systems at NYU Stern School of Business. His dissertation examines the circumstances in which good intervention decisions can be made using machine learning models, even if the models are problematic for causal-effect estimation. This has important implications because acquiring data to estimate causal effects accurately is often complicated and expensive, and results are often better when modeling intervention decisions rather than causal effects. He has also conducted work studying referrals in the ride-sharing industry; the interpretability of data-driven decions made by AI systems; and the combination of observational and experimental data to improve the intervention decisions made by machine learning models."

Have these partisan norms changed over time? How do partisan social norms affect political attitudes and behaviors? My other major project examines partisan dehumanization - an extreme form of affective polarization associated with political violence. In general, I use surveys, experiments, and various text analytic methods to study these topics."

  bio: "in Urban Information Systems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My interests lie in empirically exploring how digitization unfolds in non-western urban spaces, asking what changes, where and for whom? In my research I play with a variety of methods, merging spatial analytics, computational social science, field-based interviews and embedded observations. For my dissertation project I study the transformation of urban mobility markets in Jakarta and Bangkok through the entry of digital platforms like GoJek and Grab. Combining the granularity of big data and the contextualizing powers of qualitative research, I examine how digital workers can create collective structures of solidarity, resist the governance regime of the platform and even transform the functioning of the platform. As my work shows though these outcomes are not determined or random, but instead arise out of complex interactions between possibilities created by technology, worker agency and social norms."
