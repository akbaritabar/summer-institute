      bio: Jaren Haber is a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. His research applies computational methods to study how organizational contexts shape the impacts of structural inequalities. Jaren has studied whether charter school identities reinforce stratification by race and class, and at SICSS 2019 he joined Nick and Jae (fellow BAY-SICSS organizers) to conduct experiments evidencing how school websites' racial cues influence perceptions of school quality. He also studies text analysis workflows for social science. Jaren is currently on the job market and appreciates referrals.

      bio: Nick Camp is a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, where he received his PhD in social psychology in 2018. His research examines racial disparities in the everyday encounters between police officers and citizens, drawing on a range of methods, from computational studies of officer body-worn camera footage, experiments in community and lab settings, to analyses of traffic stop data. Starting Fall 2020, Nick will be an assistant professor of Organizational Studies at the University of Michigan.

      bio: AJ is a PhD candidate in Education at Stanford University. His research lies at the intersection of the sociology of education, sociolinguistics, and data science. His ongoing dissertation work examines a large corpus of college admissions essays written by Latinx identifying students to understand the relationships between an applicant's context and the content of their essay. Outside of research, AJ has experience with activism and advocacy in his hometown of Salinas, CA. Prior to starting the PhD program, AJ was a high school English teacher in Miami, FL.

      bio: Emily Grabowski is a PhD student in linguistics at UC Berkeley. Her research combines computational and experimental approaches to investigate the relationship between speech perception and production. She also explores applications of machine learning to speech, including the use of supervised and unsupervised methods to discover structure and applications in speech.

      image: /assets/images/mahnaz_roshanaei.jpg
      bio: Mahnaz is a Postdoc research fellow at Stanford University.  She is a computer scientist with data science skills who is interested to collaborate across disciplines and develop and apply statistical and machine learning methods on social science issues. Her current research focuses on applying computational methods to understand behavioral, network and smartphone data to explore how the individuals’ characteristics and behavior shape their position in, or effect on, social networks. Mahnaz is broadly interested in Machine learning and Causal inference to reason better with behavioral and network data to solve societal problems.

      bio: Tyler is a PhD student studying sociology at Stanford University. His current research focuses on school policies and individuals’ daily experiences with segregation. Using survey data, he compares racial and socioeconomic segregation experienced - in locations such as friends’ homes, places of worship, and shopping centers - by students who make different school choices. Broadly, he is interested in spatial inequalities, meritocracy, and predictive algorithms.

      bio: Code for America helps government work for those who need it most. Our current projects include making safety net program applications quick and easy, connecting people who need help with getting their tax refunds to Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) volunteers, and automating the clearance of criminal records so that people have greater access to jobs and housing. Our goal for the Summer Institute is to contrast the post-COVID influx of GetCalFresh (food stamp) applications with earlier applications. In what ways are new applicants and their circumstances distinctive from those in the past? What new challenges may today’s applicants be facing that ought to be receiving greater attention from policymakers or the media? Specifically, we would like to 1) identify these compositional changes and surface new challenges individuals may be facing, 2) highlight these through interactive visualizations and other content for a major revision to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stories microsite, and 3) explore research collaborations academic participants may want to pursue with us.

    - name: DonorsChoose
      image: /assets/images/ds_logo.png
      bio: DonorsChoose makes it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need, moving us closer to a nation where students in every community have the tools and experiences they need for a great education. Our project focuses on understanding the impact of school closure policies on the ability of teachers to get crucial materials to their students. We want to map trends in our daily aggregate state-level project posting data against the beginning of state school closure policies, and against state-level COVID-19 case numbers. We'd love to analyze what happened in each state when DonorsChoose implemented initiatives to allow teachers to ship materials to a location other than their school. We're hoping to get a broad understanding of which states' teachers were hit hardest by the pandemic on their ability to get materials through us, and which states' teachers are benefitting the most from our distance learning initiatives.

    - name: Hopelab
      image: /assets/images/hl_logo.png
      bio: "Hopelab is a social innovation lab that creates behavior-change tech (apps, chatbots, digital games, etc) to help adolescents and young adults live happier, healthier lives. Our project seeks to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on young people’s health and wellbeing. COVID-19 has disrupted nearly every aspect of our lives, and that’s profoundly true for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) too. There’s a lot we still don’t know, but we do know that challenges already facing AYAs in the U.S. are likely to get worse. For example: dramatic increases in social isolation and associated mental health problems in what was already the loneliest generation ever; unprecedented disruption of higher education and its value proposition, likely exacerbating financial and educational disparities; widening access barriers to maternal/child health for low income young women; increased wellbeing and safety risk for LGBTQ+ youth who may be sheltering in place in unsupportive/unsafe homes; consequences of the explosion of teen vaping, to name a few. For our project, we’d love to tap into this group’s creativity and data science toolkit to explore new ways to use high quality, publicly available datasets (e.g., teen stress and mental health surveys, federal student loan data, sexual and gender minority health data) to generate new insights into drivers of AYA vulnerability and resilience during COVID, to identify needs and digital intervention targets, and/or to create novel digital measures of impact and change over time."
