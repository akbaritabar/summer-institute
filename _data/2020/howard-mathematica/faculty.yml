  bio: "Mary Awuonda received her bachelor’s degree in Chemistry at Howard University in 2004 and proceeded to pursue a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences with an emphasis in pharmacoepidemiology, and health services research at Howard University. To expand her research experience in health services research and to continue her passion for teaching she took up a post-doctoral fellow position at the Center for Minority Health Services Research (CMHSR) in the college of pharmacy. There she was involved in consulting on research methodology and conducting statistical evaluation for CMHSR projects involving analysis of large secondary data. Her projects involved evaluating and analyzing national health care surveys, electronic medical claims, and electronic medical records. Her passion for research and teaching continued and in 2011 she accepted a faculty position as an assistant professor at the Howard University College of Pharmacy. Since then she has worked and collaborated with clinical faculty on various patient and student projects. Her current areas of interest include medication use in pregnancy, women's health issues, minority health issues, medication adherence, drug safety, global pharmacovigilance and pharmacy education. Her work as a research fellow at CMHSR continues where she supports the design and evaluation of faculty, resident and student projects. She also continues to lead efforts to revitalize funding, collaboration and infrastructure at CMHSR. More recently she facilitated a collaborative effort to compete for a workforce diversity grant through the Office of Minority Health. Through its success the Howard University National Workforce Diversity Pipeline (HU-NWDP) project was initiated at the College. Mary Maneno now serves as the co-director for the HU-NWDP project. On a personal level Mary considers herself a proud alumni of Howard and remains committed to seeking opportunities to advance its mission through her efforts at the College of Pharmacy."
