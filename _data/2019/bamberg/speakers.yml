  bio: "Andreas Jungherr is a Juniorprofessor (Assistant Professor) for Social Science Data Collection and Analysis at the University of Konstanz. He studies the impact of digital media on politics and society. He has worked on the uses of digital media and technology by publics, political actors, and organizations in international comparison. He also addresses challenges for scientific research in reaction to digital change in order to realize opportunities emerging from new data sources and analytical approaches. In this, he has focused on harnessing the potential of digital methods and computational social science while addressing methodological challenges in its integration into the social sciences. Depending on the object under study, he also uses traditional quantitative and qualitative empirical approaches. Currently, he is lead investigator of 'Communicative Power in Hybrid Media Systems', a project financed by the Volkswagen Stiftung (2017-2020). The interdisciplinary project, featuring computer and information scientists, focuses on the interconnection between political coverage in legacy, online media, and political talk on online platforms in Germany, UK, USA, and South Korea."

  bio: "Ridhi Kashyap is associate professor of social demography and fellow of Nuffield College at the University of Oxford. She completed her DPhil in Sociology jointly affiliated with the University of Oxford and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Her research spans a number of substantive areas in demography and sociology, including gender, mortality and health, the diversification of family forms, and ethnicity and migration. Her work has sought to adopt computational innovations both in terms of modelling approaches such as agent-based models and digital trace data from web and social media platforms to study social and demographic processes.  She is currently leading a Data2X and UN Foundation supported project that uses big data from the web, in particular large-scale online advertising data that provide information on the aggregate numbers of users of online platforms by demographic characteristics, to measure sustainable development and gender inequality indicators."

  bio: "Oliver Posegga is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Information Systems and Social Networks at the University of Bamberg, an affiliate of the Center for Collective Intelligence at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and a principal investigator of the project 'Communicative Power in Hybrid Media Systems', funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. His research focuses on understanding the collective dynamics of digitally enabled networks, such as collective behavior and intelligence in organizational and societal settings, and touches a variety of topics, such as the dynamics of social networks, crisis management, crowdsourcing, data- and information quality, and discursive power in contemporary media systems."

  bio: "Martijn Schoonvelde is an Assistant Professor in Political Science at University College Dublin. Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Exeter and a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. In his work, he analyzes the rhetoric of politicians. Is this rhetoric driven by strategy, ideology or aspects of their personality? Do they shift blame to others when topics are sensitive with the public? And when do they use emotional appeals? More broadly, his interests include political communication, EU politics, computational social science, and text as data."
