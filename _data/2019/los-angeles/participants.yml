In terms of method, I am building and analyzing the first large scale individual-level survey dataset about three different types of individuals in China that do not travel or immigrate into the US--those that are denied visas, those that are deterred from applying for visas and going abroad, and ex-immigrants that previously intended to immigrate but then later change their mind and return. In terms of theory, I aim to draw on this data to better understand what we already know about immigrants and contribute new insights to longstanding perennial questions about migrant selectivity, state capacity to control migration and the relationship between social stratification/mobility/inequality and international migration and travel."
