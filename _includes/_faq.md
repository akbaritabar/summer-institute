#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time.  For example, you can apply to SICSS-Duke, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline.  However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### I have a question about the eligibility criteria or application procedure at a specific location.  Who should I ask?

The eligibility criteria and application procedures are handled by each partner location individually.  You should direct your question to the partner location directly.
