The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science.
The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects.
There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government.
Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics.
There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers.
Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

The Helsinki Satellite of Summer Institute is organized by Matti Nelimarkka.
It is supported by Aalto University, University of Helsinki, Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT and Rajapinta ry.
The Helsinki Satellite is organized with the support of [Summer Institute organised at Duke](../).
We will have both streamed and locally produced content for your participants.

The course is free for participants; we are still figuring if we have the ability to support meals & lodging.

Students at University of Helsinki will directly receive credits, while students from other universities receive a certificate.
