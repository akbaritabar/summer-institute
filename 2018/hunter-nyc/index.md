The [Silberman School of Social Work](http://sssw.hunter.cuny.edu/ssw/), part of the City University of New York's [Hunter 
College](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/), will host a [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/) partner location from June 18th, 2018 to June 29th, 2018.

Whereas SICSS is for both social scientists and data scientists, broadly conceived, SICSS NYC-Hunter is a specialized
institute targeting social work students, practitioners, and scholars who have little to no exposure to computational social
science methods. The aim of the SICSS NYC-Hunter institute is to build a cohort of social work students, scholars, 
instructors, and practitioners who can employ computational social science techniques across practice areas and domains. 

The program is intended for graduate students and faculty engaged in social scientific research at the
Silberman School of Social Work. SICSS NYC-Hunter is sponsored by the Sloan Foundation and
the Russell Sage Foundation. It will be hosted at the Silberman School of Social Work, located at E. 119th street and 3rd Ave.

Participants in SICSS NYC-Hunter will gain hands-on experience in working with computational methods including learning
programming in R and Python, using version control tools like Github, and applying these tools to social science research 
problems. The curriculum will consist of a combination of livestreamed lectures and tutorials, group activities and exercises.
We will cover a broad range of computational research topics from text analysis to digital data collection.

A primary goal of SICSS NYC-Hunter is to bring together social work scholars from various areas of practice and reserach to 
share their strengths and enhance each other's work. Participants will be encouraged to workshop exisiting work, as well as develop new colaborations. There may also be pilot funding avalable. 

There is no cost to participate, and meals during the day will be provided. We will make every effort to support attendance with metro cards and child care arrangements, should there be need. 

To apply, please submit a short application by Friday, June 1st, 2018. [View application here](apply)
