# Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D.  Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. About thirty participants will be invited.  Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.  Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

# How to Apply

There is no application form or program information beyond this Announcement.  To apply, send (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (especially as it relates to RSF research priorities such as behavioral economics, social inequality, future of work, and immigration), (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages), and (iv) for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, two letters of recommendation from faculty advisors.  Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science.  All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number).  Send your CV, statement, and writing sample (all collapsed into a single pdf file) to rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.  Ask your recommenders to send their letters to the same email address, with the following subject line: RSF recommendation letter for APPLICANT NAME.

We anticipate a large pool of highly qualified applicants and to make final decisions quickly, so applications and letters must be received by the deadline. Complete applications, including letters of recommendation, must be received by Friday, February 24.  We will notify applicants solely through e-mail, by Friday, March 10 and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.
